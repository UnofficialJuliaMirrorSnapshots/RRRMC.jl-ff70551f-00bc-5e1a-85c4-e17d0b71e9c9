# [Graphs interface](@id interface)

```@meta
CurrentModule = RRRMC
```

This page contains all the functions which are needed when implementing a [graph type](@ref graphtype).
See the [built-in graphs](@ref builtin) for concrete examples (in particular, the SK, RRG and EA family of
graphs have the most complete implementations). See also the documentation for the [`Config`](@ref) type.
